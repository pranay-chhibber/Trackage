### Package tracking Website

---

# The Question

+ Low-cost high-level tracking system for packages

+ Nowadays is all about online shopping and people get really worried about the status of their package. So design a tracking system that provides real-time information about our package and possible time for delivery

---

# Technologies
+ For the Front-end we have used
    + Figma
    + HTML
    + Tailwind
    + JavaScript
    + ScrollMagic 
    + SwiperJS
    + LeafletJS
    + Python

---

# Mode Toggle
+ Now every website needs to be in both Light and Dark Mode for users as everyone has different preference 

```js
    if(document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark")){
        document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark")
        localStorage.setItem("theme","light")
        iconToggle()
        return
    }
    document.documentElement.classList.add("dark")
    localStorage.setItem("theme","dark")
    iconToggle()
```
+ We used JS to let user switch between the modes

---

# Scroll Animations
+ We used ScrollMagic to add animations to different parts of site that take place when user scrolls to that section 

```js
var controller = new ScrollMagic.Controller() 
```

+ What scrollMagic does is it uses `scrollbar` as controller, we set different trigger points and when scrollbar reaches their it adds the animation class to the component

```js 
var scene5 = new ScrollMagic.Scene({
        triggerElement: '.section5',
        triggerHook: .6, // decides the time when animation should start taking place
    })
    .setClassToggle('.section5','fade-in')
    .addTo(controller)
```

Just an example of how we use `scrollMagic` to add animations

# Testimonials

New customer always look for reviews on the product they want to buy so `testimonials` go a long way in acquiring new customers

+ Showing all the reviews together can be jaring so we decided to make the reviews in a `carousel` form 

+ Making a carousel from scratch was possible but we instead with `swiperJS` 

+ Swiper Js made the carousel so easy as we just have to add the content we want and style it. It takes cares of the functionality, uses Jquery to make it happen.

```js 
      const swiper = new Swiper('.swiper', {
      // Optional parameters
      speed: 500,
      spaceBetween: 150,
      autoplay: {
        delay: 3000
    },});
```

# Python Part

+ It accepts a number and then uses phonenumbers module to convert the string passed into format and use openCage api to get the information like Country, lat, long, service provider of the number

+ We then used json.dumps to convert the lat & long to json and sys module to write that json into a file


---

# Leaflet JS

+ We added the map using this for the tracking
+ We used routing machine as well to get the route from A->B
+ Routing machine gives direction as well
+ It takes coordinates to place the marker and circle


---


+ So now LeafletJs needs coordinates to place the marker and circle which will be provided from the ordreroid array of objects

+ If the orderId matches from the list then those coordinates are put into the Leaflet Js

+ Now the coordinates will be fetched from either the python script or from the live coordinates of our system as for now

+ The route will be from the coordinates of the courier to the delivery coordinates we have in the orderoid object


---

# Future

+ Make the python script run from the webpage itself

+ Send the number to python program from Javascript according to the orderId

+ Store the login/signup information on database and show data like previous order information after user logs into their account
